# An xpm/npm package with the Doxygen Awesome CSS custom theme

This project provides a convenient way to integrate the
[Doxygen Awesome CSS custom theme](https://jothepro.github.io/doxygen-awesome-css/)
into the xpm/npm ecosystem, by allowing to install it as a package dependency.

The open-source project is hosted on GitHub as
[xpack-3rd-party/doxygen-awesome-css-xpack](https://github.com/xpack-3rd-party/doxygen-awesome-css-xpack).

## Install

This project is available from the `npmjs.com` registry as the package
[`@xpack-3rd-party/doxygen-awesome-css`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-3rd-party/doxygen-awesome-css),
and the easiest way to add it to a project is via
**xpm** or **npm**; it can also be used as any Git project, but for
this better use the upstream project.

### Prerequisites

A recent [xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/),
which is a portable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) command line application.

It is recommended to update to the latest version with:

```sh
npm install --global xpm@latest
```

For details please follow the instructions in the
[xPack install](https://xpack.github.io/install/) page.

### xpm

To install this project as a dependency in xPack projects,
use **xpm**:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Unless a package.json is already present

xpm install @xpack-3rd-party/doxygen-awesome-css@latest

ls -l xpacks/@xpack-3rd-party/doxygen-awesome-css
```

### npm

To install the project as a dependency in **npm** projects:

```sh
cd my-project
npm init # Unless a package.json is already present

npm install @xpack-3rd-party/doxygen-awesome-css@latest --save-dev

ls -l node_module/@xpack-3rd-party/doxygen-awesome-css
```

## Branches

In addition to the original `main` branch, there are two
xPack specific branches:

- `xpack`, with the latest stable version (default)
- `xpack-develop`, with the current development version

All development is done in the `xpack-develop` branch, and contributions via
Pull Requests should be directed to this branch.

When new releases are published, the `xpack-develop` branch is merged
into `xpack`.

When there are new upstream releases:

- upstream `main` is merged into the local `main`
- the local `main` is merged into `xpack-develop`
- the project is tested
- `xpack-develop` is merged into `xpack`

The original README follows.

#  Doxygen Awesome

</div>

**Doxygen Awesome** is a custom CSS theme for Doxygen HTML documentation with lots of customization parameters.

## Motivation

I really like how the Doxygen HTML documentation is structured! But IMHO it looks a bit outdated.

This theme is an attempt to update the visuals of Doxygen without changing its overall layout too much.

## Features

- ðŸŒˆ Clean, modern design
- ðŸš€ Heavily customizable by adjusting CSS variables
- ðŸ§© No changes to the HTML structure of Doxygen are required
- ðŸ“± Improved mobile usability
- ðŸŒ˜ Dark mode support!
- ðŸ¥‡ Works best with **doxygen 1.9.1** - **1.9.4** and **1.9.6** - **1.12.0**

## Examples

Some websites using this theme:

- [Documentation of this repository](https://jothepro.github.io/doxygen-awesome-css/)
- [wxWidgets](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/)
- [OpenCV 5.x](https://docs.opencv.org/5.x/)
- [Zephyr](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/doxygen/html/index.html)
- [FELTOR](https://mwiesenberger.github.io/feltor/dg/html/modules.html)
- [Spatial Audio Framework (SAF)](https://leomccormack.github.io/Spatial_Audio_Framework/index.html)
- [Randolf Richardson's C++ classes](https://www.randolf.ca/c++/docs/)
- [libCloudSync](https://jothepro.github.io/libCloudSync/)
- [libsl3](https://a4z.github.io/libsl3/)

## Installation

To use the theme when generating your documentation, bring the required CSS and JS files from this repository into your project.

This can be done in several ways:

- manually copying the files
- adding the project as a Git submodule
- adding the project as a npm/xpm dependency
- installing the theme system-wide

All theme files are located in the root of this repository and start with the prefix `doxygen-awesome-`. You may not need all of them. Follow the install instructions to figure out what files are required for your setup.

### Git submodule
For projects that use git, add the repository as a submodule and check out the desired release:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css.git
cd doxygen-awesome-css
git checkout v2.3.4
```

### npm/xpm dependency

In the npm ecosystem, this project can be added as a development dependency
to your project:

```sh
cd your-project
npm install https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css#v2.3.4 --save-dev

ls -l node_module/@jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css
```

Similarly, in the [xPack](https://xpack.github.io) ecosystem, this project can be added
as a development dependency to an [`xpm`](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/)
managed project.

### System-wide

You can even install the theme system-wide by running `make install`.
The files will be installed to `/usr/local/share/` by default,
but you can customize the install location with `make PREFIX=/my/custom/path install`.

### Choosing a layout

There are two layout options. Choose one of them and configure Doxygen accordingly:

<div class="tabbed">

- <b class="tab-title">Base Theme</b><div class="darkmode_inverted_image">
    ![](img/theme-variants-base.drawio.svg)
    </div>
    Comes with the typical Doxygen titlebar. Optionally the treeview in the sidebar can be enabled.

    Required files: `doxygen-awesome.css`

    Required `Doxyfile` configuration:
    ```
    GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES # optional. Also works without treeview
    DISABLE_INDEX = NO
    FULL_SIDEBAR = NO
    HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome.css
    HTML_COLORSTYLE        = LIGHT # required with Doxygen >= 1.9.5
    ```

- <b class="tab-title">Sidebar-Only Theme</b><div class="darkmode_inverted_image">
    ![](img/theme-variants-sidebar-only.drawio.svg)
    </div>
    Hides the top titlebar to give more space to the content. The treeview must be enabled in order for this theme to work.

    Required files: `doxygen-awesome.css`, `doxygen-awesome-sidebar-only.css`

    Required `Doxyfile` configuration:
    ```

    GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES # required!
    DISABLE_INDEX          = NO
    FULL_SIDEBAR           = NO
    HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome.css \
                            doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome-sidebar-only.css
    HTML_COLORSTYLE        = LIGHT # required with Doxygen >= 1.9.5
    ```

</div>

<br>

@warning
- This theme is not compatible with the `FULL_SIDEBAR = YES` option provided by Doxygen!
- `HTML_COLORSTYLE` must be set to `LIGHT` since Doxygen 1.9.5!
